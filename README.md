# AISParticleFilter
Java code for AIS tracking Particle Filter implemented for Special Topic 1
NOTE: This is just to upload the code I have written onto Github, and does not have any functionality. While the java files are here, since I have not uploaded the dataset that is used for this particle filter, it will not function.
